Apologize

Swear

Snap your fingers

Clap audibly

Mispronounce a word

Hum three notes

Say three consecutive words beginning with the same letter

Say to consecutive rhyming words

Say the number of fingers held up on your left hand

Remain silent for ten seconds

Interrupt the investigator

Say your last name

Fail to complete a sentence

Repeat a question word for word

Say "What"

Say at least three consecutive letters

Begin a new sentence with the last word spoken
